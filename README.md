# FamilyTree
This program I have built a database program that stores a collection of
people and  their biological relatives.  You can then search this database based
on the relationships between the people it contains. 
# This Program Should : 
- identify the positions/roles of each relative
- inform the user the decendents of a relative
- inform the user the siblings of a relative
- inform the users specific information of the relative, this can include `birthdays` and `favorite food` or even `pet names`.

# How to use the program
When in terminal after you run the program using some type of input like this `./test data/Family.tsv`

your input should look something simular to this : 
`name's input` - the input can be anything to identify what you want to look into, this including `siblings`, `parents`, `cousins`, `nephews`, etc.
